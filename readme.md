Welcome to Fetchr's Settings SDK documentation!
===============================================
This client library is used for communicating with fetchr's settings api 
(see `settings api documentation <https://api.fetchr.us/#settings-api>`_).

##Installation
To install fetchr-settings using pip, on your terminal enter

```shell

pip install fetchr-settings

```
An alternative is to install from source. First, make sure the requirements
are installed. This library depends on the `requests` library and optionally, 
`redis` if caching is to be supported. On your terminal enter

```shell

python setup.py install

```
to install the library.
